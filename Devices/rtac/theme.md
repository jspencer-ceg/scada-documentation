Change the AcSELerator RTAC theme
#################################

The default theme for AcSELerator RTAC is annoying and you should change it to the :guilabel:`Seven Classic` theme.

1. Open an RTAC project and go to the :guilabel:`View` tab. In the :guilabel:`Application Appearance` section, expand the menu of styles by selecting the lower of the three buttons on the right:

      .. image:: img/theme/acrtac-view-tab.png
         :scale: 30%
         :align: center

#. Select the :guilabel:`Seven Classic` style:

      .. image:: img/theme/acrtac-select-seven-classic.png
         :scale: 30 %
         :align: center

#. This is what the style looks like after it is selected:

      .. image:: img/theme/acrtac-seven-classic-initial.png
         :scale: 30 %
         :align: center

   The blue hue in the background of the project tree will change to gray after AcSELerator RTAC is restarted:

         :scale: 30 %
         :align: center

   This is what the project window looks like with the Seven Classic theme:

         :scale: 30 %
         :align: center

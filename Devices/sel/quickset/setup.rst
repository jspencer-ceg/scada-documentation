AcSELerator QuickSet Setup

************
Installation
************

If installing from Compass, select the option to see advanced options during installs.

When installing QuickSet, you will be asked to set a password for the AcSELerator database. Set a password that is easy to remember. The SEL model number for the software is SEL-5030, so an easy-to-remember choice would be ``Ceg5030!`` for the password.

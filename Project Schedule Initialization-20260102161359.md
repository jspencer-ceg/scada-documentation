**Project Schedule Initialization**
**Substation**
When you’re first assigned a project, you should request the following information from the project engineer responsible:
*   Existing project schedule, with at least the following information (if the project schedule does not have this information, please request this information separately):
    *   Kickoff/Project Start (disregard if officially kicked off)
    *   Any SCADA set due dates. If full SCADA set due dates are not available, request the following:
        *   30% set submission (overall package, not SCADA)
        *   60% set submission (overall package, not SCADA)
        *   90% set submission (overall package, not SCADA)
        *   IFC set submission (overall package, not SCADA)
        *   Date when panels are being ordered/set to order off of
        *   Date when control house is being ordered/approved (or set to order off of)
        *   Energization date
        *   Backfeed date
        *   COD date
*   Location of project (and ISO/QSE)
*   Utility
*   Owner
*   Who is responsible for BOP (Balance of Plant) SCADA

Please note that this is not considered a complete list of information you will need for the course of the project. This is just the information needed for an initial project schedule.

This information will help create a basic project schedule. This schedule should be submitted to the project engineer for approval, but it should provide a reasonable outline for project deliverables.

Some important things to keep in mind: SCADA sets often do not align substation deliverable dates – the SCADA package needs inputs from the substation package, so if engineers have not finalized their package, it may not be possible to finalize SCADA (it is typical to either lag a certain about of time – for example, SCADA is due two weeks after substation – or lag a set – SCADA 60% would be due when substation 90% is due. If the overall project schedule has SCADA and project deliverables at the same time, please flag this for the project manager and note that SCADA will need at least 1-2 weeks to pick up any changes to the substation set.

**Power Plant Controller (PPC)**
When you’re first assigned a project, you should request the following information from the project engineer responsible (please note that this may come from a single contact – if not designed by CEG – or you may need to request this from both the PV team and substation team, internal or external):
*   Existing project schedule, with at least the following information (if the project schedule does not have this information, please request this information separately):
    *   Kickoff/Project Start (disregard if officially kicked off)
    *   Any SCADA set due dates. If full SCADA set due dates are not available, request the following:
        *   30% set submission (PV)
        *   60% set submission (PV)
        *   90% set submission (substation)
        *   90% set submission (PV)
        *   IFC set submission (substation)
        *   IFC set submission (PV)
        *   Energization date
        *   Backfeed date
        *   Inverter Hot Commissioning Dates
        *   Tracker Hot Commissioning Dates
        *   COD date
*   Location of project (and ISO/QSE)
*   Utility
*   Owner
*   Substation SCADA Vendor
*   Inverter Manufacturer
*   Tracker Manufacturer

Please note that this is not considered a complete list of information you will need for the course of the project. This is just the information needed for an initial project schedule.
This information will help create a basic project schedule. This schedule should be submitted to the client for approval, but it should provide a reasonable outline for project deliverables.

| **Milestones** | **Date** |
| ---| --- |
| Scope Document | Project Kickoff |
| 30% SCADA Set Submission | As Specified in Schedule or At the Same Time as the PV 60% |

| As Built Drawings | As Built mark ups should be started at the FAT and tracked through full site testing – at this point, there should not be significant other changes |

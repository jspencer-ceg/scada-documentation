# SCADA Drafting Standard Requests

Copied from SCADA Fun. Original file dated 2020-09-30.

## SCADA Standards
*   When marking up things for internal SCADA review, save in Design Docs -> SCADA -> Markups.
    *   Action item: Clarify with Letysha/drafting department how the data link files work – can we directly edit those spreadsheets?
    *   When we mark up changes on the PDF rather than editing the data link file, sometimes only the autocad gets edited, not the data link file
*   How do drafters want to see markups from us?
    *   Email attachments? Folder location with a similar path for each project?
*   How can we manage using the BOMs for procurement?
    *   Set up different tabs for drawing vs procurement management vs cable lengths
*   PDF files – printing these is resulting in 22x34 on some and 11x17
    *   This affects scaling on pages as well
    *   Some control house drawings are missing scale
*   Line weight – Orchard WD-09 and WD-10 have different line widths between the two drawings
    *   Setting in Autocad that scales line weights based on drawing size
    *   Matters more on WDs where back of panels are shown because reading port numbers is difficult with the thicker lines
*   Can we make tables in drawings with autocad tables rather than imported tables? (See panel elevations)

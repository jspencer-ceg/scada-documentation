Initial setup

After successfully installing RTAC AcSELerator, set up a user account for yourself so that edits to RTAC projects can be traced to individual engineers instead of the default ``admin`` or ``engineer`` accounts.

1. Log in with the default ``admin`` account. The password is ``TAIL``.

   After a successful login, you will receive a warning about default passwords. Select :guilabel:`OK`.

#. Select the :guilabel:`SEL` menu in the upper-right corner of the screen and select :guilabel:`Options`.

#. In the :guilabel:`SEL AcSELerator RTAC Options` window, select :guilabel:`User Management` from the menu on the left and then select :guilabel:`User Accounts`.

#. In the :guilabel:`User Accounts` window, use the :guilabel:`+` button to add an account for yourself. Set :guilabel:`User Name` to your CEG email userame, set the role to Administrator, and enter your full name in the :guilabel:`Description` column. Set a memorable password. Nick suggests using ``Ceg5033!`` because the SEL model number for the software is 5033. Select :guilabel:`Close` when done, and then :guilabel:`OK` to exit the :guilabel:`SEL AcSELerator RTAC Options` window.

#. Now, log in with your new credentials. In the AcSELerator RTAC project list window, select :guilabel:`Database` in the lower-right corner.

#. You will see the default password warning again. To eliminate the warning, select :guilabel:`OK` and then go back to the :guilabel:`User Accounts` window. For each of the default ``engineer`` and ``admin`` accounts, select the row for the account and select the :guilabel:`-` button to delete the account, and then confirm that you want to delete it. When done, select :guilabel:`Close` and then :guilabel:`OK`.
